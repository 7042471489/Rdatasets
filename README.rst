What is this?
=============

Rdatasets is a collection of datasets that are distributed alongside the statistical software environment R and some of its add-on packages. The goal, here, is to make these data more broadly accessible for teaching and statistical software development. 
 
csv
===

The ``csv`` folder includes all the collected datasets in comma-separated value format. I saved any data I could find in objects of class ``data.frame``, ``matrix``, ``numeric``, and ``table``. 

html
====

The ``html`` folder includes copies of the R documentation files for each dataset in plain html format. These docs appear to be licensed under GPL.
